# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

In this demonstration, I highlight my proficiency in Exploratory Data Analysis using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I also demonstrate my understanding of Risk Analytics in banking and financial services, emphasizing how data-driven approaches can mitigate lending risks and enhance decision-making.

Objective of the Case Study:

The primary objective of this case study is to detect patterns that signal potential payment difficulties among loan applicants. These patterns can inform actions such as loan denial, adjusting loan amounts, or offering higher interest rates to risky applicants. By identifying these indicators, the company aims to ensure that creditworthy consumers are not unfairly rejected. Additionally, understanding the key driver variables behind loan default assists in portfolio management and risk assessment. Researching risk analytics and variable significance will enhance your domain knowledge in this area.
